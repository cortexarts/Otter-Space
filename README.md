[Otter Space](https://github.com/cortexarts/Otter-Space)
==================================================

Otter Space is an educative space adventure developed by CortexArts.

You are Captain Dimitri, the amazing commander of the Ottership.
Why you, as a simple otter, are shuttled into otterspace is obvious: planet Earth is messed up by humans. 
There is no tree, soil or water fit for you to live. The Soviet Onion has elected you to discover a new haven for otterkind, 
and find some decent wood on the go. You have a nose for trees nonetheless.
